# FullStack
This was my final project for CS 290, Intro to Web Development. It's a Full Stack MERN app that uses MongoDB for the database, REST API to handle post/get/delete/put requests, and a React front-end. This demonstrates my skills in web development, including Javascript, CSS, HTML, and database management.
